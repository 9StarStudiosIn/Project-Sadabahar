 Beginner project for Godot 3.2.x

![Couldn't find preview](https://i.imgur.com/oo6GaT3.png)


## Purpose

Starting with Godot, it can be hard to find tutorials that teach you how to get a basic game up and running in 3D. I created this project so that people starting with Godot do not have to spend a lot of time figuring out how to do basic tasks like saving games or creating dialog boxes. Please keep in mind that I do not recommend you use the code or methods in this project for your actual game. The project is simple for the sake of teaching and does not follow best practices and isn't very extendable. That said, the project can still help you wrap your head around a variety of concepts very easily.

## Features

- Basic third-person player controller
- A very small quest system
- Start screen and HUD
- Saving and loading your game

## Controls

- WASD to move player
- Shift + A/D to rotate player
- E to interact with objects
- Q to use active objects
- Z to complete dialog
- Space to pause the game
- Escape to go to the Start Screen

## Bugs

- The 3d models have weird artefact when viewed from a distance
- The NPC might stop playing the animation after the player has been in it's range a couple of times
